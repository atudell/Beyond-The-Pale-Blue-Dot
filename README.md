# Beyond-The-Pale-Blue-Dot

Beyond the Pale Blue Dot is a celebration of the nature of space. Providing only a glimpse of the majesty of the cosmos, this website simultaneously showcases the wonders 
that lay beyond our pale, blue dot. Daily uploading images of distant galaxies or wonders found near our own stellar backyard, the majesty of space is on full display.

This website is a portfolio project for Andrew Udell. Employing Flask as a backend and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend, this shows a simple fullstack solution. 

NOTE 1: The security module was intentionally left out and demo security keys are used in the Github code for security purposes

Note 2: The current implementation uses an SQLite database, which is a legacy from testing. Once the site goes into production and uses a more mature solution, the Github
page will be updated
