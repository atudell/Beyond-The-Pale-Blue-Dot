			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				Beyond the Pale Blue Dot is a celebration of the nature of space. Providing only a glimpse of the majesty of the cosmos,
				this website simultaneously showcases the wonders that lay beyond our pale, blue dot. Daily uploading images of distant
                galaxies or wonders found near our own stellar backyard, the majesty of space is on full display.
